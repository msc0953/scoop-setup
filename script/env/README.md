# Environment specific installations

Now that you have scoop setup (if you don't please [READ](../../) and follow), you can run any of the following scripts using:

```
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://github.com/juliostanley/scoop-setup/raw/master/script/env/usual.ps1?raw=true');
```

From the previous command make sure to replace 'usual.ps1' with whichever script you wish to run.
